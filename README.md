# OCR with EAST Text Detection and EMNIST Character Recognition

[Project Description]

This repository contains an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that combines two important components: text detection using the EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text) model and character recognition using a custom model trained on the EMNIST dataset. The OCR system aims to accurately detect and recognize text from images.

## Features

- Text detection using the EAST model
- Character recognition using a custom model trained on EMNIST
- Achieves a high recognition accuracy of 97 percent
- Simple and easy-to-use Python scripts
